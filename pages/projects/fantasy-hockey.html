            Introduction
        </h3>
        <p>
            The world runs on data, and after finishing 8th out of 10 in my fantasy hockey league last year, 
            I knew I needed to leverage the worlds most valuable resource to improve my fantasy hockey game. 
            For some context, this is a keepers league (you keep some players every passing season) and we are 
            in our fourth season. At the end of each season, every team is allowed to protect 12 players that  
            are on their roster, and the remaining 7 players from their roster are dropped into the draft pool for next year. This 
            leads to a 7 round draft from all players not currently on someones roster. Rookies and recently dropped 
            players are popular picks in these drafts, but I wanted to leverage data to confirm this. Google Cloud Platform 
            is an ensuite of cloud computing services that give your data superpowers. They offer a $300 free credit for new 
            accounts to try out these services (which was more than sufficient for this project). Google Cloud Storage and 
            Google's VertexAI are the two services that I used for my project. Data will be uploaded to Cloud Storage, used to 
            create a dataset in VertexAI, to train a model using Google's powerful AutoML tool, and to predict fantasy points for a 
            player based off quantitative inputs such as age, height, weight, game score, corsi etc. My goal was to have this 
            machine learning model tell me the best draft eligible players to consider (within a certain degree of confidence).
            Let's dive into to the methods behind my madness!
        </p>

        <h3>
            Identify A Data Source
        </h3>
        <p>
            The first, and most important step, in creating any machine learning model is acquiring a high quality dataset. After 
            searching around online I stumbled upon www.moneypuck.com/data.htm which contains extensive player data for the past 
            13 seasons (Shoutout to the moneypuck team as they update their high quality data frequently). This dataset was perfect 
            for identifying how many fantasy points a certain player would have put up in previous seasons, but I was still lacking 
            a data source containing information about the players height, weight, and age. For this data I needed to use NHL's suprisingly 
            undocumented API. Shoutout to dword4 on GitHub for providing documentation found from many different sources on the web explaining 
            the different endpoints that NHL makes accessible. I created a python script to do the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Send a request to get all the active teams in the league for a specific year</li>
            <li>Get ID's for all the active teams for append it to a list</li>
            <li>Loop through every team in the league and initiate a request to get roster data</li>
            <li>Send a request for each player listed on the roster to get their respective id, name, age, weight and height</li>
            <li>Write the player JSON data to a CSV file and save it as player info for the specified year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I ran this python script to get player data from the last 5 NHL seasons. We have sufficient data to start cleaning and restructuring 
            our CSV files now!
